# Dinosaur Game

A Rust implementation of the classic Chrome Dinosaur Game. This project is built with the Bevy game engine and runs on native platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and the web (via WebAssembly).

## How to Play

You can play the web version of the game [here](https://dino.lqxclqxc.com).

## Downloads

You can download the latest native versions of the game from the [releases page](https://github.com/lovebaihezi/dinosaur-game/releases).

## Release Process

This project uses an automated release system:

- **Stable Releases**: Created automatically when the version in `crates/game/Cargo.toml` is updated and pushed to the main branch. The workflow creates a version tag (e.g., `0.1.0`) which triggers builds for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS x86_64, macOS ARM64).

- **Nightly Releases**: Created automatically on weekdays (Monday-Friday) via scheduled workflow. Tagged with the format `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD`.

To create a new stable release:
1. Update the version number in `crates/game/Cargo.toml`
2. Commit and push to the main branch
3. The automated workflow will create a tag and trigger the build process
4. Binaries will be available on the releases page once builds complete

- `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - A code change that improves performance
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build` - Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
- `ci` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert` - Reverts a previous commit

**Examples:**
```
